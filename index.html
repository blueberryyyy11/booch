                term: "Complexity in Software",
                definition: "Software is inherently complex due to problem domain complexity, development process management difficulties, flexibility of software, and problems characterizing discrete systems.",
                details: "Brooks suggests that much of software complexity is arbitrary, not essential, stemming from communication gaps between users and developers.",
                example: "Building a large e-commerce system involves managing user interactions, payment processing, inventory, and security - all complex domains that must work together seamlessly."

                details: "These attributes help us understand and manage complexity in systems ranging from computers to biological organisms.",
                example: "A computer system has a hierarchical structure (hardware &rarr; CPU &rarr; ALU &rarr; gates), uses common patterns (NAND gates throughout), and evolves from stable intermediate forms."
            },
            {
                chapter: 1,
                term: "Hierarchic Structure",
                definition: "Complex systems are composed of interrelated subsystems that, in turn, have their own subsystems, forming a hierarchy down to elementary components.",
                details: "This structure is a major factor that facilitates understanding, description, and visibility of the system and its parts.",
                example: "Plants consist of roots, stems, and leaves; roots contain branch roots, root hairs, etc.; all the way down to cells and organelles."

            {
                chapter: 1,
                term: "Relative Primitives",
                definition: "The choice of what components in a system are primitive is relatively arbitrary and is largely up to the discretion of the observer.",
                details: "What is primitive for one observer may be at a much higher level of abstraction for another.",
                example: "To a botanist, a cell might be a primitive component of a plant. To a molecular biologist, the cell itself is a complex system composed of organelles, proteins, and DNA."

                chapter: 1,
                term: "Separation of Concerns",
                definition: "Intracomponent linkages are generally stronger than intercomponent linkages, separating high-frequency dynamics from low-frequency dynamics.",
                details: "This principle allows us to study each part of a system in relative isolation, as the system is 'nearly decomposable'.",
                example: "In a plant, the parts of a leaf work together closely (strong intracomponent linkages) but have little direct interaction with the elementary parts of the roots."

                chapter: 1,
                term: "Common Patterns",
                definition: "Complex systems exhibit economy of expression - composed of only a few different kinds of subsystems in various combinations.",
                details: "These patterns may involve reuse of small components (cells) or larger structures (vascular systems) found across different organisms.",
                example: "Computer systems reuse NAND gates in both CPU and memory. Biological systems reuse cells as fundamental building blocks across organs."
            },
            {
                chapter: 1,
                term: "Stable Intermediate Forms",
                definition: "Complex systems evolve from simple systems much more rapidly if there are stable intermediate forms.",
                details: "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. Objects that were once complex become primitive building blocks.",
                example: "The internet evolved from simple networking protocols (ARPANET) to today's complex global network, with stable intermediate forms at each stage."

                chapter: 1,
                term: "Organized vs Disorganized Complexity",
                definition: "Organized complexity has discernible structure and patterns; disorganized complexity lacks perceptible commonality among parts.",
                details: "Discovery of common abstractions and mechanisms greatly facilitates understanding of organized complex systems. For example, an experienced pilot can quickly learn to fly a new aircraft.",
                example: "An experienced pilot can quickly learn to fly a new aircraft due to organized complexity - common controls and systems across different aircraft."

                chapter: 1,

                definition: "The standard form combining class structure ('is a' hierarchy) and object structure ('part of' hierarchy) with the five attributes.",
                details: "Most interesting systems embody multiple hierarchies simultaneously. Collectively, class and object structures form the system architecture.",
                example: "A bicycle combines a structural hierarchy ('part of': Frame &rarr; Wheels &rarr; Hub) and a classification hierarchy ('is a': Vehicle &rarr; Bicycle &rarr; Mountain Bike &rarr; Full-Suspension model)."

                details: "Each object in object structure is a specific instance of some class. Usually many more objects than classes exist in a system.",
                example: "Plant &rarr; Fruit &rarr; Apple (class structure). Garden &rarr; [Plant objects, GrowingPlan object] (object structure)."

                chapter: 1,

                definition: "The class and object structures of a system collectively define its architecture.",
                details: "No single architecture can be deemed 'correct'. Finding balance between structure options, five attributes, and user needs is challenging.",
                example: "Different architectures for the same system might prioritize performance, maintainability, or scalability differently."
            },

                details: "Results in systems where procedures act on data structures. Traditional structured design approach.",
                example: "File update system: steps like 'Get formatted update', 'Add checksum', 'Process record', 'Write to master file'."

                definition: "Better at organizing complexity, yields smaller systems through reuse, more resilient to change, reduces risk through incremental evolution.",
                details: "OO decomposition addresses inherent complexity by helping with separation of concerns in large state spaces.",
                example: "A banking system with Account, Customer, Transaction objects adapts more easily to new regulations than procedural approaches."

                details: "Called 'chunking' - we use chunks of information with increasingly greater semantic content to manage complexity.",
                example: "Studying photosynthesis by focusing on chemical reactions in cells while ignoring roots and stems, using 'cell' as abstraction."

                details: "Object structure shows collaboration patterns (mechanisms). Class structure highlights common structure and behavior.",
                example: "Study one photosynthesizing cell instead of each individual cell, because all exhibit similar behavior via class hierarchy."
