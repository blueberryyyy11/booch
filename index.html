                details: "Brooks suggests that much of software complexity is arbitrary, not essential, stemming from communication gaps between users and developers.",
                example: "Building a large e-commerce system involves managing user interactions, payment processing, inventory, and security - all complex domains that must work together seamlessly."

                details: "These attributes help us understand and manage complexity in systems ranging from computers to biological organisms.",
                example: "A computer system has a hierarchical structure (hardware → CPU → ALU → gates), uses common patterns (NAND gates throughout), and evolves from stable intermediate forms."

                chapter: 1,
                term: "Hierarchic Structure",
                definition: "Complex systems are composed of interrelated subsystems that, in turn, have their own subsystems, forming a hierarchy down to elementary components.",
                details: "This structure is a major factor that facilitates understanding, description, and visibility of the system and its parts.",
                example: "Plants consist of roots, stems, and leaves; roots contain branch roots, root hairs, etc.; all the way down to cells and organelles."

                chapter: 1,
                term: "Relative Primitives",
                definition: "The choice of what components in a system are primitive is relatively arbitrary and is largely up to the discretion of the observer.",
                details: "What is primitive for one observer may be at a much higher level of abstraction for another.",
                example: "To a botanist, a cell might be a primitive component of a plant. To a molecular biologist, the cell itself is a complex system composed of organelles, proteins, and DNA."

                chapter: 1,

                definition: "Intracomponent linkages are generally stronger than intercomponent linkages, separating high-frequency dynamics from low-frequency dynamics.",
                details: "This principle allows us to study each part of a system in relative isolation, as the system is 'nearly decomposable'.",
                example: "In a plant, the parts of a leaf work together closely (strong intracomponent linkages) but have little direct interaction with the elementary parts of the roots."

                chapter: 1,

                definition: "Complex systems exhibit economy of expression - composed of only a few different kinds of subsystems in various combinations.",
                details: "These patterns may involve reuse of small components (cells) or larger structures (vascular systems) found across different organisms.",
                example: "Computer systems reuse NAND gates in both CPU and memory. Biological systems reuse cells as fundamental building blocks across organs."

                chapter: 1,
                term: "Stable Intermediate Forms",
                definition: "Complex systems evolve from simple systems much more rapidly if there are stable intermediate forms.",
                details: "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. Objects that were once complex become primitive building blocks.",
                example: "The internet evolved from simple networking protocols (ARPANET) to today's complex global network, with stable intermediate forms at each stage."

                chapter: 1,
                term: "Organized vs Disorganized Complexity",
                definition: "Organized complexity has discernible structure and patterns; disorganized complexity lacks perceptible commonality among parts.",
                details: "Discovery of common abstractions and mechanisms greatly facilitates understanding of organized complex systems. For example, an experienced pilot can quickly learn to fly a new aircraft.",
                example: "An experienced pilot can quickly learn to fly a new aircraft due to organized complexity - common controls and systems across different aircraft."

                details: "Most interesting systems embody multiple hierarchies simultaneously. Collectively, class and object structures form the system architecture.",
                example: "An aircraft has structural hierarchy (propulsion, flight-control systems) and classification hierarchy (jet engine → turbofan → specific model)."

                details: "Each object in object structure is a specific instance of some class. Usually many more objects than classes exist in a system.",
                example: "Plant → Fruit → Apple (class structure). Garden → [Plant objects, GrowingPlan object] (object structure)."

                definition: "The class and object structures of a system collectively define its architecture.",
                details: "No single architecture can be deemed 'correct'. Finding balance between structure options, five attributes, and user needs is challenging.",
                example: "Different architectures for the same system might prioritize performance, maintainability, or scalability differently."

                details: "OO decomposition addresses inherent complexity by helping with separation of concerns in large state spaces.",
                example: "A banking system with Account, Customer, Transaction objects adapts more easily to new regulations than procedural approaches."
